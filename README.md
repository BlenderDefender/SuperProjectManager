# Blender PM (Project Manager)
Managing your unfinished Projects streamlined. Features:
- Create your Project Folders consistently. With the click of a button, all your project folders are
created and the Blender File is saved into the right folder.
- Automatically append a version number to your Blender File, if needed.
- Display your unfinished Projects in Blender, so you'll never forget about them.
